**Project: Acoustic-based Sensing and Applications**
* Reviewed acoustic-based sensing in terms of hardware infrastructure, technical approaches, and its broad applications in recognition \& tracking, localization \& navigation, security \& privacy, and communication
* Discussed future research directions and limitations of the acoustic-based sensing

**Project: Inaudible High-throughput Acoustic Communication**
* Designed an acoustic communication system, which achieves high-throughput and inaudibility simultaneously, and the highest throughput we achieve is 12 times higher than the state-of-the-art acoustic communication systems
* Modeled the non-linearity of the mobile deviceâ€™s inbuilt microphone and use Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) technique together with the non-linearity model to transmit data bits over multiple orthogonal channels with an ultrasound frequency carrier
* Proposed an algorithm to eliminate the unrelated residual signals induced by Amplitude Modulation (AM)

**Project: Monitoring Movement Dynamics of Robot Cars and Drones**
* Proposed a smart system that can monitor the movement dynamics of carrying platforms (i.e., robot cars and drones) leveraging the inertial sensors of the attached smartphone
* Monitored the movement dynamics of carrying platforms in real time, such as moving speed, displacement, and position
* Achieved real-time movement dynamics sharing with the backend server through WiFi connection
