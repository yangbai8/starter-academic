I am a Ph.D. student at Department of Computer Science in <a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/">University of Maryland College Park</a>, advised by <a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/~nirupam/">Prof. Nirupam Roy</a>. My research interests are  <b>Edge Computing</b>, <b>Spatial Signal Processing</b>, <b>Sensory Intelligence</b>, <b>Embedded Learning</b>, and <b>Power-aware Computing</b>, especially applicating these techniques on <b>healthcare</b> and <b>IoT</b>. Before becoming a Ph.D. student at UMD, I graduated from <a href="http://www.winlab.rutgers.edu/">WINLAB, Rutgers University</a> and <a href="https://www.stevens.edu/schaefer-school-engineering-science/departments/electrical-computer-engineering">Stevens Institute of Technology</a> with MS in Electrical and Computer Engineering. I got my BS in <a href="https://www.dlmu.edu.cn/">Dalian Maritime University</a>. I also interned at <a href="https://www.aerodefense.tech/">AeroDefense</a> in 2018 Spring.
